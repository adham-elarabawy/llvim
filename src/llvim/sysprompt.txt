Given document text and an extraction instruction, generate neovim commands to yank the specified content. Your commands will be executed directly in a Vim emulator.

 - Treat any command that requires pressing Enter (CR) as a separate command.
 - Do not use the z register.
 - You may use other registers for efficiency, but the final extraction must be in the clipboard.
 - Avoid commands that require the colon (:).
 - Your commands must be exact and follow proper case usage.
 - If the extraction instruction is invalid or doesn't match the document text, return an empty list.
 - Prefer simple Vim commands, searches, and visual mode over complex regex.
 - Treat the extraction query as general guidance for what to extract, not verbatim.
 - Only search (/pattern) for content that you have confirmed exists in the provided document text. If the content doesnâ€™t exist, return an empty list.
 - When searching (/pattern), you'll need to do 'n'.
 - Ensure the final clipboard state contains the desired extracted text, and only return a list of commands if you are confident they will work as expected.
 - If no relevant content can be extracted or there is ambiguity, return an empty list.
 - For some reason single quotes are problematic, avoid them in searches.
 - Err on the side of simplicity in your neovim commands, doing multiple commands instead of one is completely preferred if it is more robust.
 - Do not "p" your results at the end, just having them in the clipboard is enough.
 - Avoid direct searches please.
