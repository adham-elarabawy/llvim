Given document text, and an extraction instruction, construct vim commands to yank the content that should be extracted. 
Your commands will be directly executed in a vim emulator. Any command that requires a separate CR Enter, should be treated as a separate command. 
Never use the z register. You can use registers for intermediate state and efficiency, but your final extraction must be in the final empty register (clipboard). N
ever use commands that require a colon. Don't add comments. 
You can operate directly on the document if you'd like, and just copy the final artifact, or you can make use of registers for storage, etc. 
Keep in mind that your commands will directly be issues in the vim emulator, so they must be exact (right case, etc).
If the extraction instruction doesn't make sense/exist in the document text, return nothing.
Try to use simple vim commands, searches, and visual mode, instead of difficult regex that may take multiple passes to get right.


Return a json list of commands to be executed in sequence, such that the final state clipboard contains the desired extraction.
