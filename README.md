**Verifiable and Token-Efficient Text Extraction Using LLMs and Vim Commands.**


LLVim uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with text documents through Vim commands. This approach ensures extracted content exists in the source text, eliminating hallucinations common in traditional LLM extraction. LLVim achieves over 95% reduction in token usage compared to verbatim extraction methods. It implements a headless Neovim instance to execute LLM-generated Vim commands, providing verifiable and efficient information extraction.
